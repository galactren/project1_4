<h2>Who is Rithya?</h2>
<p>Hello, My name is Rithya. Yes, My last name is just the letter Y.
    I am an adoptee.

    I was a medic in the U.S. Army and currently a tow truck driver.
    My hobbies are computers, cars, motorcycles, and traveling/outdoor adventures.
    My goals for the future is to learn more about programming and write clean code. The position I want to be in is that of an AWS certified cloud practitioner.
